# <h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Yael Tapia 🖖 </h1>

## About me:  
---
I'm a **self-taught** programmer and a graduate in Audio Engineering. 
Everything I know about programming, from basics of several languages to complex projects, I've learned on my own. 
I'm currently focusing on web development and data analysis, and this GitHub is where I share the projects that shows my progress.

## My Skills: 
---
I started my programming journey two years ago by learning **Python**.
That knowledge soon branched into various tools and frameworks within Python, such as **Django and SQLite**, as well as other languages and technologies like **SQL (PostgreSQL), HTML, CSS, and Git**.
I'm currently learning Pandas and Docker, while also exploring Java, as I pursue a career in **Web Development** and **Data Analysis**.
Through my different projects, I've gained experience in CLI applications, Django architecture, web design, and third-party API integration.
I'm excited to continue this journey, improving my skills and expanding my knowledge as I work on new projects.

## My Projects:
